### Day 1: February 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first course in FCC's Responsive Web Design, which was "Learn HTML by building a Cat Photo App".

**Thoughts:** I've already completed the HTML portion of TOP, so this was a nice refresher, and was pretty straightforward.

### Day 2: February 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Got about 80% of the way through the second course in FCC's Responsive Web Design, which deals with basic CSS.

**Thoughts**: Found this pretty straightfoward as I'd encountered a lot of this in TOP, looking forward to working with flex further on in the course as this is what I have struggled with in the past.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A
